## Git-Flow

This repository is maintained in a simplified [Git-Flow](http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/why-arent-you-using-git-flow/) fashion: All active development happens on the ```develop``` branch while ```master``` is used to create tagged releases from.

### Pull Requests

Using Git-Flow means that PRs have the highest chance of getting accepted and merged when you open them on the ```develop``` branch of your fork. That allows for some post-merge changes by the team without directly compromising the ```master``` branch, which is supposed to hold always be in a release-ready state.
